## Data Structures & Algorithms for Problem Solving

**Problem : Hashing**

**Task** : Implement an Unordered Map.

**Aim** : To learn how Hashing works and importance of Hash Functions. Also look how Universal Hashing is implemented.

**Functions to implement:**
```
1. insert(key, value) – insert key value pair.
2. erase(key) – erase if key is present otherwise do nothing.
3. find(key) – returns true or false.
4. map[key] – returns the value mapped to key.
```
**Note** : Unordered Map should be generic. No inbuilt functions are used.
